## Algorithm

The implemented Algorithm is an improved version of my own implementation which checks the direction of a movement through two defined zones. ST implemented a nice and efficient way to track the path from one to the other direction. I migrated the algorigthm with some changes into the Roode project.
The concept of path tracking is the detecion of a human:

- In the first zone only
- In both zones
- In the second zone only
- In no zone

That way we can ensure the direction of movement.

The sensor creates a 16x16 grid and the final distance is computed by taking the average of the distance of the values of the grid.
We are defining two different Region of Interest (ROI) inside this grid. Then the sensor will measure the two distances in the two zones and will detect any presence and tracks the path to receive the direction.

However, the algorithm is very sensitive to the slightest modification of the ROI, regarding both its size and its positioning inside the grid.

ST Microelectronics define the values for the parameters as default like this:

The center of the ROI you set is based on the table below and the optical center has to be set as the pad above and to the right of your exact center:

Set the center SPAD of the region of interest (ROI)
based on VL53L1X_SetROICenter() from STSW-IMG009 Ultra Lite Driver

ST user manual UM2555 explains ROI selection in detail, so we recommend
reading that document carefully. Here is a table of SPAD locations from
UM2555 (199 is the default/center):

```

This table is oriented as if looking into the front of the sensor (or top of
the chip). SPAD 0 is closest to pin 1 of the VL53L1X, which is the corner
closest to the VDD pin on the Pololu VL53L1X carrier board:

```
  +--------------+
  |             O| GPIO1
  |              |
  |             O|
  | 128    248   |
  |+----------+ O|
  ||+--+  +--+|  |
  |||  |  |  || O|
  ||+--+  +--+|  |
  |+----------+ O|
  | 120      0   |
  |             O|
  |              |
  |             O| VDD
  +--------------+
```

However, note that the lens inside the VL53L1X inverts the image it sees
(like the way a camera works). So for example, to shift the sensor's FOV to
sense objects toward the upper left, you should pick a center SPAD in the
lower right.

#### Threshold distance

Another crucial choice is the one corresponding to the threshold. Indeed a movement is detected whenever the distance read by the sensor is below this value. The code contains a vector as threshold, as one (as myself) might need a different threshold for each zone.

The threshold is automatically calculated by the sensor. To do so it is necessary to position the sensor and, after turning it on, wait for 10 seconds without passing under it. After this time, the average of the measures for each zone will be computed and the thereshold for each ROI will correspond to 80% of the average value. Also the value of 80% can be modified in the code, by editing the variable `threshold_percentage`

## Hardware

There will be a specific Hardware setup (recommended brands etc.) soon!

- ESP8266 or ESP32 (Wemos D1 mini case will be available)
- 1x VL53L1X (Pololu, GY-53 and cheap chinese sensors)
- Power Supply
- Encolsure (see .stl files) - will be updated soon!
  Pins:
  SDA_PIN 4 or 21 (ESP32)
  SCL_PIN 5 or 22 (ESP32)

## Configuration

### ESPHome

Configue at least the secrets.yaml with your wifi SSID and password to connect. Check the peopleCounter.yaml or peopleCounter32.yaml to adapt the exposed sensors to your needs.
